/*Now refactor the JavaScript code so that we can split the code into small Components.

- wrap the creation of the circle element including the `addEventListener` into a separate function starting with a capital letter, e.g. `Circle`
- after the element is created and all modifications are applied, return the element
- call the function and save the returned value a variable, e.g. `circleElement`
- append the element to the root element.

The circle should now be visible as before. Now we need to outsource the component into its own file.

- create a file `Circle.js` inside the [Circle](./components/Circle) folder
- move the component function inside this file and export it as the default.
- import the component function inside the `index.js`.

> ðŸ’¡ Hint: If the circle doesn't show up, you might need to move some imports into the Circle component as well.

Now repeat the previous steps for the square and the pentagon.*/
import Square from "./components/Square/Square.js";
import Circle from "./components/Circle/Circle.js";
import Pentagon from "./components/Pentagon/Pentagon.js";

const circleElement = Circle();
root.append(circleElement);

const squareElement = Square();
root.append(squareElement);

const pentagonElement = Pentagon();
root.append(pentagonElement);
